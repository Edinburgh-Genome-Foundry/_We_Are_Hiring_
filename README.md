We are looking for an enthusiastic computational software engineer to join the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, one of the largest automated platforms for synthetic biology globally.

The Foundry is a unique facility at the University of Edinburgh specialized in large-scale genetic engineering projects for academic and industrial research. We are automating the assembly of genetic constructs up to chromosome size, with an ambition to deliver custom DNA seven days a week with minimal human intervention from order to shipping.

You will use your computational and organizational skills to help us develop the services that orchestrate our platform, making it smarter, faster and more reliable. This is a rare opportunity to help shape the future of biology while working on exciting research projects (e.g. in gene and cell therapy, metabolic engineering) and developing expertise in computer-aided DNA design and manufacturing, software architecture for automation, and web development.

Your work will be mainly open-source and have visibility in the Synthetic Biology and Laboratory Automation communities, enabling biological projects at an unprecedented scale!
